# The Open Source LabVIEW Icon Editor

Just recently, the LabVIEW Icon Editor has been made open source to encourage collaboration between NI and the LabVIEW Community. Every new build of LabVIEW will grab the icon editor that has been pushed into the `main` branch from this repo.

The direction of the LabVIEW Icon Editor and which new features are added, and which are left out, is decided by the core team, which includes NI staff and LabVIEW community volunteers (sometimes referred to as a “cathedral” style of development).

That being said, the Icon Editor is great because of the LabVIEW users who use it, share their code with the community, and discuss ways to make LabVIEW even better. Some of the most important and undervalued work in open source is from non-code contributions, and that is where we can use the most help from you.

# Our Contributing Philosophy

This repo is managed via [git](https://git-scm.com), with the canonical upstream repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor) and it follows a pull-request model for development. If you wish to contribute, you will need to create a GitHub account, fork this project, push a branch with your changes to your project, and then submit a pull request.

# How can I help?

The things we need the most help for the library and its community are:

**🐛 Bug reports:** We simply can’t catch them all. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues/new/choose) and discussion first, then [create a new issue](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues/new/choose) to tell us what’s up.

**💬 Answering questions and provide feedback**: New features begin by creating a discussion on our [board](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/new?category=ideas), you can provide feedback to the new features that are planned to be added to the icon editor. This is an [example](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/55) of a discussion for a new feature request. 

🎬 **Work on ["Good first issue"**](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/labels/good%20first%20issue) items: You can right now assign yourself action items to finish or test a feature. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues) section and look for any issue labeled as [Good first issue](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/labels/good%20first%20issue).

**✏️ Edit our [Docs](https://labview-icon-editor.dev/docs/introduction/)**: Make changes in the [labview-icon-editor-docs repo](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor-docs), or click the "edit this page” button that lives on every doc site.

All interactions should be done with care following our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Enhancements

If you have an idea or suggestion for an enhancement to the LabVIEW Icon Editor library, please use the [New Features](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/categories/new-features) discussion section. **please make sure to start a discussion about your changes.** The direction of the LabVIEW Icon Editor and which new features are added are discussed in our Discord Server and in [this GitHub discussions section](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/categories/new-features), and in the end, they are decided by the core team.

Talking to us first via the discussions section about the enhancement you want to build will be the most likely way to get your pull request into the library (see Our Contributing Philosophy above). We would hate to see you write code you’re proud of, just to learn that we’ve already been working on the same thing, or that we feel doesn’t fit into the core library.

Once your idea has been selected for the next release of LabVIEW, a branch will be created that you can submit your pull request to.

## Creating a discussion for a new feature

The first step to start an enhancement to the icon editor is to create a discussion on the [New Features](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/categories/new-features) discussion board. You must describe the problem that made you want to have this enhancement.
