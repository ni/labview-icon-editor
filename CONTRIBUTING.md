## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the **open-source LabVIEW Icon Editor** project! This repo is maintained under the **MIT license**, enabling collaboration between **NI** and the **LabVIEW community** to improve the Icon Editor. Ultimately, each official **LabVIEW release** automatically pulls the Editor from our `main` branch, so **your contributions** can appear in LabVIEW updates.

## 2. Repository Overview

- **Pre-Release**: Currently supports **LabVIEW 2021–2025**, with a **green default** theme. You can modify and test it at will.  
- **Steering Committee**: Consists of NI staff and select community volunteers (a “cathedral” style approach). They determine which issues or features are ready for external dev work by labeling them as **“Workflow: Open to contribution.”**  
- **Discord Server**: Join [this channel](https://discord.gg/q4d3ggrFVA) for real-time discussions about new features, bug triage, and general Q&A.  

**Key Note**: We value both **code and non-code contributions**—testing `.vip` packages, improving docs, or providing UI feedback are equally important to shipping a robust Icon Editor.

<a name="cla"></a>
## 3. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can merge a Pull Request from **any** external contributor, you will need to **sign our Contributor License Agreement** (CLA). This ensures that:

- NI and other users of the Icon Editor have the legal right to distribute your code under the **MIT license**.  
- You retain any necessary rights to your contributions, but also formally allow them to be incorporated into LabVIEW releases.

**How to sign the CLA**: Instructions will be provided when you open your first Pull Request. You’ll be guided through a quick, one-time CLA process.

## 4. Contributing Philosophy

We use a **pull-request model** on [GitHub](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor). The key principles:

- **MIT License**: Minimizes legal barriers for external devs.  
- **Steering Committee & BDFL**: The committee (including NI & community members) steers day-to-day decisions; major roadmap calls remain with NI.  
- **Workflow Labeling**: An issue labeled “**Workflow: Open to contribution**” indicates it’s **ready** for external devs to work on.  
- **Feature Branch**: Once assigned, you’ll use a dedicated feature branch to do your dev work.

**Success Example**: Another open-source LabVIEW component (Actor Framework) saw a **7% build-time improvement** from a community fix. We anticipate the Icon Editor will see similar benefits.

## 5. How to Contribute

You can contribute by **fixing bugs**, **adding new features**, **testing** other people’s PRs, or **enhancing docs**. Below is how to get started:

<a name="entrypoint"></a>
### Entry Point: Assigning Issues

1. **Check Labeled Issues**: Go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Workflow%3A%20Open+to+contribution%22).  
2. **Comment**: If you see something you’d like to tackle, let us know in the issue thread (e.g., “I’d like to fix this—please assign me!”).  
3. **Assignment**: The Steering Committee or maintainers assign you, confirming you can begin development.  

> **No label, no assignment** → The issue is either under internal discussion or not yet ready for external dev.

<a name="featurebranch"></a>
### Feature Branch Creation

- **After You’re Assigned**: A feature branch is either generated by a GitHub Action or created by maintainers.  
- **Fork & Clone**: Typically, you’ll fork the repo, clone your fork, and then pull this feature branch locally.  
- **Implement & Test**: Use LabVIEW 2021–2025 with the green-default Icon Editor to validate your changes.  
- **Open a Pull Request**: Reference the issue in your PR. The CI pipeline builds a `.vip` package for easy testing by others.  
- **CLA Reminder**: If this is your first contribution, the CLA check will appear. Please sign it before we can merge.

## 6. Non-Code Contributions

Non-code contributions are **crucial** to a thriving open-source project. Some ways you can help:

1. **Testing**  
   - Download and install `.vip` artifacts from open pull requests.  
   - Verify the fix or feature in your LabVIEW environment and report any findings in the PR thread.  

2. **Documentation**  
   - Improve or expand `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or Wiki pages.  
   - Provide clear examples, usage steps, or troubleshooting tips for new users.  

3. **UI/UX Feedback**  
   - If the green-default theme or certain UI flows seem confusing, open an issue or discussion.  
   - Propose improvements to the Icon Editor’s layout or design elements.  

4. **Issue Triage**  
   - Help confirm if a reported bug is reproducible.  
   - Provide logs, screenshots, or more context for existing issues.  

5. **Community Moderation**  
   - Welcome new contributors on Discord.  
   - Encourage respectful, inclusive communication.

**Remember**: Non-code contributions often lead to the biggest improvements in usability, clarity, and overall adoption.

## 7. Creating a Discussion for a New Feature

1. **Open a Discussion**: [Start a new Discussion](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/new/choose) or bring it up on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/q4d3ggrFVA).  
2. **Gather Feedback**: Let the Steering Committee and community weigh in.  
3. **Issue Creation**: If the idea is approved, an issue labeled `Workflow: Open to contribution` will be made.  
4. **Assignment & Branch**: Once you comment to claim it, a feature branch is created, and you can start development.

## 8. Enhancements

If you have an **enhancement** to existing functionality, it’s best to discuss it first (on Discord or GitHub Discussions). That ensures:

- No duplicate work or overlapping ideas.  
- Alignment with the Steering Committee’s roadmap.  

If the committee agrees, they’ll add `Workflow: Open to contribution` to an issue. After you’re assigned, begin coding on the assigned feature branch.

## 9. Reporting Issues

1. **Open a New Issue**: [Click here](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues/new/choose) to file a bug or unexpected behavior. Provide as many details as possible—LabVIEW version, steps to reproduce, logs/screenshots, etc.  
2. **Label Decision**: The Steering Committee triages the issue. If it’s ripe for external help, they label it `Workflow: Open to contribution`.  
3. **Get Assigned**: Comment on the issue if you want to fix it; the maintainers assign you.  
4. **Implementation**: Work on the newly created or designated feature branch.  
5. **Pull Request**: Submit your changes, sign the CLA if needed, and wait for the `.vip` tests to confirm everything.
